OK, everybody's written about this, but I just wasted a bunch of time making an
iPhone app.

I don't actually feel too bad about it because it was a [pretty stupid][1]
iPhone app, anyway, but I'm not going to finish it because my first attempt to
run it outside of the simulator was going to cost me a hundred bucks.

The application is an iPhone port of my [twister][2] app, but with worse
graphics and sound (though the sound is at least *potentially* better).  It's
functional enough to play a few games, but not fully polished.

I was hoping I could stick it on my daughter's iPhone so she could play, but
doesn't seem to be the case.

If anyone wants to do something with it, it's over on [github][1].

Of course, I'd love to find out I was wrong and I can actually run my own
program on my own phone without paying more...
