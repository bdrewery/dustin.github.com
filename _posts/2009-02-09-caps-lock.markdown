# Making Use of Caps Lock

<div>
  <img src="/images/capslock-pref.png" alt="caps lock" class="floatright"/>
</div>

If you're like me (and who isn't), the caps lock key is an annoying
waste of plastic.  Its only value seems to be to type things to offend
people.  Luckily, most operating systems allow you to map it to
control, or another useful key.

As a fairly new emacs user (and a long-term shell user), having a
control key near where my fingers already makes many things far more
accessible to me.  Highly recommended.

But there's another thing that the caps lock provides that quickly
moves from annoyance to useful feature:

<div>
  <img src="/images/capslock-key.jpg" alt="caps lock" class="floatleft"/>
</div>

Just about every keyboard ever made has a caps lock indicator.  Such a
wonderful thing when used correctly.

Amit Singh over at google had a blog post about
[manipulating keyboard LEDs][leds] which inspired me to add this feature
to my [buildwatch][buildwatch] app pretty much immediately.

Due to a fairly dumb bug I fixed today, it hasn't been working (and I
wasn't paying attention to it anyway), but now, when anyone does a
build against my build farm and the build breaks, my keyboard light
will come on.

Sort of makes me want to write some bad code.
