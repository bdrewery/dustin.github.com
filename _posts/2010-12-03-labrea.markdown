# (re)Presenting La Brea

I realize it's a little lame to have two posts in a row on the same
topic.  I've done a lot of work here and the first one wasn't very
well understood, so let's just pretend like it never happened.

I thought perhaps I can make up for it slightly by using a medium I'm
not particularly accustomed to -- a video slideshow thingy.

In my previous post, I described La Brea as a great development tool
for when your computer is too fast.  There I demonstrated a use case
where I injected some calls and made stuff go slowly.  I hand-waved
out some "future" direction of the project and thought people would
get it.

I got a lot of feedback, mostly telling me I should buy more, older
computers and carry them around, or that I can't get a meaningful test
with a fault injection framework.  This is clearly a failing on my
part of communicating my vision.

But we've already established that didn't happen, so allow me to
introduce you to [La Brea][labrea].

Feedback welcome.
