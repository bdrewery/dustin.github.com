# ZFS for MacOS X

So I'm a pretty heavy [ZFS][zfs] user.  I've got a FreeBSD box with a ZFS
root that all my important stuff is on, and a mac mini with ZFS that
all my movies are on.

Around Snow Leopard, Apple seemed to have not only dropped support for
it, but the download from [macosforge][mforge] seemed to not work,
either.

I've been hoping someone would come around and fix this, but nothing's
happened.

Then today, I read this:

    The ZFS project has been discontinued. The mailing list and
    repository will also be removed shortly.

That made me very sad, so I decided to do something about it.

## Github Project

I set up a [mac-zfs][mczfs] project on github and started hacking.  It
didn't take long and I was able to get to my zpool that has all of my
music.  (for the record, Bad Religion was my ZFS test case)

## Downloads

I wanted to make it a bit easier to get going, so I created an
[installer].

You still need to kind of know what you're doing to make use of it.
But I'm hoping we can work together to make it easy for everybody.
