I joined [github][github] about a year ago today.  Kind of.  It was
actually February 29th, but there isn't one of those this year, so I'm
going to have to wait a few more years before I can properly have an
anniversary.

Between the time I joined and the time I typed this line, I've
generated 206 pages of activity ([174 pages public][githubactivity]).

By the end of my first day, I had migrated two [java][spymem]
[projects][photo] over from mercurial, converted a [ruby
project][dfreebase] from subversion, had that repo forked, watched
another [ruby project][god], started a [new objective c
project][buildwatch], wrote some new code for some of my projects and
pushed it and invited a [couple][chris] of [friends][ian] (both of
whom now share my leap-year-only start date) and added them to a
couple of my projects.

[Chris][chris] became somewhat a github evangelist and made some
really [cool][compass] [stuff][freebase] stuff there (some if it's
cooler than most people can comprehend).  [Ian][ian] throws awesome
parties (I'll eventually make him give me code).

At the point where I started using github, I'd probably been a
(somewhat casual) git user for about two weeks.  git is great, but the
documentation and tutorials were more about laying out an infinitely
complex decision tree -- that is, git itself is easy to do anything
with, but you can do a lot with it, so it comes across as
unnecessarily complex.

Github has been really good about making really common paths really
easy so that you naturally fall into workflows that minimize the work
required to contribute to open source projects down to the point where
you can clone a repo, branch, edit some stuff, and notify the
maintainer of a project in just a few clicks on the web site.

Overall, it's been a pretty [good year][can].  Just three more until
my real anniversary.
