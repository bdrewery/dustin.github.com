# Building Your Site Connectivity

When I started building this jekyll site, I thought it'd be nice to link to
all the other places I leave junk around the internet.  Rather than manually
building a list, I took a bit of time to write something to do it for me using
the [google social graph API](http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/).

I made a simple [web form](http://public.west.spy.net/autolinks.html) to do
this that generates HTML source so it can be further hand-edited if needed, but
more importantly, so that I can actually paste the results into my github page
and have it actually count for site connectivity.

If you don't maintain a list of links on your own page, you may find it helpful
to link to your [friendfeed](http://friendfeed.com/) account.

For example, you can see
[how friendfeed links me](http://public.west.spy.net/autolinks.html?u=http://friendfeed.com/dlsspy).
Change the username from dlsspy to yours for results that make more sense to
you.

I hope someone finds this useful.
